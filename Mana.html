			<h2>Imagine</h2>
			<p>Speaking of which, at the rate pony is completely taking over the world, I wouldn't be surprised if Intel and AMD released hardware support for pony in the next few years. How cool would that be? You'd have direct chip-level acceleration of all pony games, applications, and episode playback. Let's take that one step further; how about a dedicated pony chip required on all logic boards? The show would be so ubiquitous by that point that it would just make good business sense to include such a thing. </p>
